## üìå Overview 
This repository contains my project on **Software-Defined Radio (SDR)** technology, focusing on RF signal analysis, digital modulation techniques, and security implications of wireless systems. The project demonstrates:
- RF signal capture and analysis
- Implementation of a replay attack on a wireless doorbell
- Generation of RF packets from scratch
- Decoding of hidden messages in RF transmissions

This project showcases practical skills in SDR technology and wireless security.

## Methodology

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup

```bash
sudo apt install gnuradio
sudo apt install inspectrum
```

```bash
#libiio dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libxml2-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libserialport-dev libavahi-client-dev libzstd-dev
git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio.git
cd libiio
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -DCPP_BINDINGS=ON -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

```bash
# gr-iio dependencies
git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-iio.git
cd gr-iio
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SDR Setup
- Connect the SDR device to the computer
```bash
ssh root@192 .168.2.1 # password = analog
```
```bash
fw_setenv attr_name compatible
fw_setenv attr_val ad9364
reboot
fw_setenv compatible ad9364
reboot
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Running GNU Radio and setting up the flowgraph
```bash
gnuradio-companion
```
- Use the transmitter and receiver flowgraphs provided in the repository.
- Play around with the values in the graph until you get a clear signal.
- The captures can be analysed in Inspectrum.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Replay Attack
- Use Inspectrum to find the peaks in the signal.
- Use the transmitter flowgraph to replay the signal.
- This atack was executed on a doorbell and it successfully replayed the signal and the doorbell rang.
- The signal can also be generated from scratch by analysing the captured signal. This can be done using vector source block in gnu radio.
